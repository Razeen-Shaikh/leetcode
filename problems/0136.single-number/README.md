# 136. Single Number

Given a **non-empty** array of integers `nums`, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 <= nums.length <= 3 \_ 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- <code>-3 \* 10<sup>4</sup> <= nums[i] <= 3 \* 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
